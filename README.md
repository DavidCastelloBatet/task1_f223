Task 1 for Flutter & Dart - The Complete Guide [2021 Edition]

## Getting Started

Solve the tasks outlined in the video (starting code is attached).

Create a new Flutter App (flutter create flutter_assignment, then replace your main.dart with the attached one) and output an AppBar and some text below it (i.e. in the body of the page)

Add a button (e.g. RaisedButton) which changes the text (to any other text of your choice)

Split the app into three custom widgets: App, TextControl & Text
